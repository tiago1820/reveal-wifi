### About
Revel WiFi decodes the QR code of the WiFi network you are connected to.

### Who are you?
I am Tiago de Oliveira, an aspiring backend developer with enthusiasm for designing and building useful and interesting things.

### Why did you build this?
I built this on a night when I was feeling very bored. I remembered being curious about the Wi-Fi password whenever someone shared it with me via a QR code. I spent the whole night developing this script, which I now use on my smartphone through the command line in Termux.

### Technical stuff?
I built this using Node.js and TypeScript, along with the dependencies jimp for handling image processing and qrcode-reader for decoding QR codes.

### How can I contribute to the project?
